# Cosmological-Galaxies-Distribution-Map-in-Space
The galaxies distribution based on GAIA DR14 Data in Kaggle 


## Kaggle

This work was originated from kaggle kernel 
https://www.kaggle.com/salmanhiro/cosmological-galaxies-distribution-map-in-space

based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14: Classification of Stars, Galaxies and Quasars database by Lennart Grosser, taken from SDSS DR14 Portal.

## Usage

The notebook was done on jupyter-notebook on Kaggle, using `pandas, numpy, astropy, matplotlib,` and `seaborn`.
This is a simple starter kit for data mining and visualisation. 
I also include a html page from the notebook for the sake of easiness as a reading. 

## DNN

The second part is Dense Neural Network prediction of astronomical objects (Galaxies, stars, QSOs). This project was currently under optimalization.
